# Coastline-Prediction-Using-Climate-Change-Models
In this live script, we explore "Coastline Prediction Using Climate Change Models" by analyzing landmarks and world maps, creating a correlation matrix, and applying curve fitting techniques including linear and polynomial fittings, along with evaluating the results. We also utilize the Regression Learner and Classification Learner for comprehensive model training and prediction.
