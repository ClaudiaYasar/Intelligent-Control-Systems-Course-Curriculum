# Intelligent-Control-Systems-Course-Curriculum

# Description

This teaching package introduces the Intelligent Control Systems Curriculum using MATLAB Live Scripts, PDFs, and supporting videos. Topics include model-based vs. data-driven systems, computational tools, dynamical modeling, machine learning, deep learning, model predictive control, extremum seeking control, model reference adaptive control, and fuzzy logic control strategies supported by performance evaluation. This course has been designded for both undergraduate and postgraduate Control and Automation Engineers. 

Some practical experiments are carried out with Arduino-based and low-cost hardware, including the TC-lab (with heaters and temperature sensors), a DC micro gear motor with an encoder using the L298N Dual H-Bridge, and image processing using a webcam. Some videos support the datasets of many experiments and illustrate systems results to evaluate performances enhancing the learning experience. 

The package consists of a series of MATLAB Live Scripts https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html with complementary material. 
MATLAB https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html is a programming and numeric computing platform developed by MathWorks.

# Instructions
The teaching materials can be approached by following each of the required subjects one by one and studying the presented Material.

# Live Scripts
The instructions inside the Live Scripts will guide you through the activities and examples. We suggest running each section within a Live Script individually. Use the Interactive Live Script and experiment with their suggested material and additional hyperlinks that provide additional information. 

# PDFs Material
Some subjects can also be approached by following presentations that will provide links to complementary resources.

# Experimental platforms
This teaching package employs Arduino-based, low-cost hardware for hands-on experiments. The platforms include the TC-lab with two heaters and temperature sensors https://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/ArduinoTemperatureControl, a DC micro gear motor, and image processing using a webcam. These setups allow students to use and evaluate datasets, providing practical experience in intelligent control systems.

# Videos 
Recorded experiments are utilized to collect and create our datasets, allowing for detailed evaluation and comparison of performance across various subjects within the curriculum.
